A proof of concept for using AWS SSO with Next.js

Many thanks to [tigaron](https://github.com/tigaron) who provided example using page router.
I've re-adapted his example with app router instead.

## Getting Started

### Setup AWS SSO SP
I used https://www.samltool.com/sp_metadata.php with `openssl genrsa -out server.pem 2048`

### Setup AWS SSO IDP
TODO

### Setup `.env` file
